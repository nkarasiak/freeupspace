# Satellite Tracker Refactor

## Overview
This satellite tracking application has been refactored to improve maintainability, separation of concerns, and code organization.

## New Architecture

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **UI Components**: Handle user interface interactions and display
- **Services**: Manage business logic and data operations
- **Utils**: Provide reusable utility functions
- **Core**: Orchestrate the overall application flow

### 2. CSS Extraction
- Removed all CSS from `index.html`
- Organized styles into modular, focused stylesheets
- Better maintainability and reusability

### 3. Type Safety
- Centralized type definitions in `types/` folder
- Improved TypeScript support and IDE assistance

### 4. Configuration Management
- Satellite data moved to dedicated configuration files
- Easier to maintain and update satellite information

### 5. Modular Components
- **CockpitComponent**: Manages the top cockpit UI and status display
- **SearchComponent**: Handles satellite search functionality
- **SatelliteDataService**: Manages satellite data and calculations
- **SatelliteCalculator**: Provides satellite position calculations

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear separation of UI and business logic
- Modular architecture allows for independent testing and development

### Scalability
- Easy to add new features or satellite types
- Component-based architecture supports growth
- Service layer allows for easy data source changes

### Developer Experience
- Better IDE support with improved TypeScript integration
- Clearer code organization makes onboarding easier
- Modular CSS prevents style conflicts

### Performance
- Better code splitting opportunities
- Lazy loading potential for components and services
- Reduced bundle size through tree shaking

## Migration Notes

### Before Refactor
- Single large `main.ts` file (683 lines)
- CSS embedded in HTML (697 lines)
- Mixed concerns throughout codebase
- Hard-coded satellite data

### After Refactor
- Modular components averaging 100-200 lines each
- Separate CSS files for better organization
- Clear separation of UI, business logic, and data
- Configurable satellite data sources

## Usage

The refactored application maintains the same external API and functionality while providing a much cleaner internal architecture.

### Key Classes
- `SatelliteTrackerApp`: Main application orchestrator
- `SatelliteDataService`: Manages satellite data and calculations
- `CockpitComponent`: UI controls and status display
- `SearchComponent`: Satellite search functionality

### Development
```bash
npm run dev       # Development server
npm run build     # Production build
npm run typecheck # TypeScript validation
```

## Future Enhancements

With this new architecture, future improvements are much easier to implement:

1. **Plugin System**: Add new satellite data sources or visualization modes
2. **Testing**: Unit tests for individual components and services
3. **State Management**: Add Redux or similar for complex state scenarios
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load satellite data and components on demand
5. **Web Workers**: Move heavy calculations to background threads
6. **Caching**: Implement smarter caching strategies for satellite data

## Backward Compatibility

The refactored application maintains full backward compatibility with existing URLs, bookmarks, and user workflows. All external APIs remain unchanged.
